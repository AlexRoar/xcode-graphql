# Xcode Add-ons

These add-ons add syntax highlighting for NASM document files to Xcode.

## Installation via script

The fastest way to install is to `cd` into the directory where this repo has been checked out or downloaded, and run one of the included install scripts.

Once the setup script has finished, restart Xcode and click the "Load bundle" button on the permissions dialog that appears in Xcode when it restarts. 

### Anything other than Xcode 11

The script to run for versions of Xcode other than 11.x is `setup.sh`: 

```bash
$ sudo ./setup.sh
```
